git status                                  # See what's changed locally (Optional)
git add .                                   # Stage your changes
git commit -m "message"                     # Commit your changes
git pull                                    # Get latest from remote (If changes were made elsewhere)
git config --global credential.helper store # Store username and password so you don't have to enter it every time
git push                                    # Push your changes up

How to have two branches (one for production, one for development)

INITIAL SETUP (once)
--------------------
git checkout -b dev
git push -u origin dev


DAILY TESTING (frequent commits)
---------------------------------
git checkout dev
# make changes...
git add .
git commit -m "testing xyz"
git push origin dev

# On other devices:
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev


PROMOTE TO PRODUCTION (when polished)
--------------------------------------
git checkout main
git merge --squash dev
git commit -m "Add polished feature X"
git push origin main
git checkout dev


QUICK COMMANDS
--------------
Work on tests:      git checkout dev
Push test code:     git push origin dev
Promote to main:    git checkout main && git merge --squash dev
Push production:    git push origin main
Back to testing:    git checkout dev


BRANCHES
--------
dev  = messy test commits, sync across devices
main = clean polished commits only
